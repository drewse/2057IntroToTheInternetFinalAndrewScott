    <div class="columns">
        <div class="column">
            <p>Online dangers provide serious concerns to both persons and organisations in the current digital ecosystem. Malware, which includes worms, trojans, ransomware, and viruses, is one frequent threat. Malware can infiltrate networks and systems, jeopardising confidential information, interfering with business processes, and resulting in losses. Another common concern is phishing assaults, in which fraudsters pose as trustworthy organisations in an attempt to fool consumers into disclosing sensitive information like passwords or bank account information. These attacks, which can result in identity theft, financial fraud, or unauthorised access to accounts, frequently happen via email, social media, or phoney websites. Furthermore, the goal of DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks is to flood a server or network with traffic so much that it is inaccessible to authorised users. These dangers emphasise how crucial it is to put strong security measures in place to guard against harmful activity online.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <p>There are several security methods that can be used to lessen these internet dangers. The most important step in identifying and getting rid of harmful software from computers and networks is to utilise antivirus and antimalware software. Frequent software updates and patches are also necessary to fix security holes that hackers could use to access computers. Strong access controls, such least privilege access and multi-factor authentication, can help stop unauthorised users from accessing private information or resources. Users can lessen their chance of falling victim to phishing attacks by learning about cybersecurity best practices, which include avoiding dubious links or attachments and using strong, one-of-a-kind passwords. In addition, enterprises can use intrusion detection systems, firewalls, and encryption to secure network traffic and shield data from illegal access or interception. Individuals and organisations can reduce the impact of potential security breaches and improve their defences against common online threats by implementing a multi-layered strategy to cybersecurity.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <p>In addition, fighting online dangers requires cultivating a culture of cybersecurity awareness and attention. This entails putting rules and processes for incident response and data protection into place, as well as educating staff members to spot and report suspicious activity. Frequent risk assessments and security audits can assist in locating possible weaknesses and setting priorities for repair work. Insights and resources for improving security posture and keeping up with new threats can also be obtained via working with government organisations, cybersecurity specialists, and industry partners. In the end, safeguarding digital assets and maintaining confidence in the online environment necessitates a proactive and cooperative approach involving individuals, organisations, and the larger cybersecurity community.</p>
