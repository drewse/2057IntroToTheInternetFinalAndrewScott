            <h2>Evolution of E-commerce</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Early Development: With the advent of technology like Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), which allowed companies to share data electronically, the idea of electronic commerce began to take shape in the 1970s.</li>
                <li>Internet's initial development: The 1990s saw the emergence of the internet and the subsequent development of online commerce as we know it today. The idea was invented by businesses like Amazon and eBay, which provided a marketplace for online shopping and selling.</li>
                <li>Growth and Innovation: With the advent of safe payment methods and enhanced logistics, e-commerce experienced a sharp upsurge in the early 2000s. With the introduction of smartphones at this time, mobile commerce (m-commerce) also began to take off.</li>
                <li>Integration of technology: In order to improve client personalisation and the purchasing experience, e-commerce platforms have recently integrated technology such as augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI).</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Evolution of E-commerce Continued...</h2>
            <p>Over time, e-commerce has changed dramatically, changing how people shop and conduct business. Because consumers can now peruse and buy a large variety of things from the comfort of their homes, online retail behemoths like Amazon, Alibaba, and Walmart have grown. Online sales are increasing yearly due to the fact that many people choose e-commerce due to its accessibility and convenience.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, without the constraints of conventional brick-and-mortar storefronts, e-commerce has created new opportunities for companies of all sizes by enabling them to access a worldwide audience and run around the clock. Thanks to platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce, small businesses and entrepreneurs can now easily establish online storefronts, which encourages innovation and competitiveness in the e-commerce industry.</p>
